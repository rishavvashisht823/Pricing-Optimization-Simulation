# Pricing Optimization Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a pricing optimization simulation for a retail dataset. The objective was to estimate revenue impact of price adjustments across popular products.

## Files Included

- *Pricing_optimisation.ipynb*  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for data cleaning, simulation, and analysis.

- *Pricing optimization simulation.csv*  
  Cleaned dataset with calculated revenue metrics for each product.

- *Pricing_Optimization_Simulation_Report.docx*  
  A detailed project report summarizing objectives, methodology, and results.

- *Pricing_Optimization_Simulation_Presentation.pptx*  
  A presentation deck outlining key findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

## Overview

### Objective
To simulate how adjusted pricing affects revenue across top-selling products and identify the most impactful price changes.

### Methodology
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
- Calculated original revenue and simulated new revenue after applying percentage price increases.
- Ranked products by revenue impact.
- Generated a report and presentation to communicate results.

### Key Insights
- Most products showed significant revenue uplift with moderate price adjustments.
- The top 3 products generated the highest absolute revenue gains.
- Further analysis can include price elasticity modeling and demand forecasting.

## How to Use
1. *Run the Jupyter Notebook*  
   - Open Pricing_optimisation.ipynb in Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.
   - Execute each cell to replicate the simulation.

2. *Review Results*  
   - Refer to the .csv file for detailed revenue data.
   - Use the .docx report and .pptx presentation for summaries and visuals.
